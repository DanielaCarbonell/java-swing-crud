# User Manager Swing

A simple Java Swing application for managing users through a graphical form.  
Users can enter their first and last name, add them to a list, and clear the input fields.  
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP), event handling with Swing,  
and basic data storage using an `ArrayList`.
